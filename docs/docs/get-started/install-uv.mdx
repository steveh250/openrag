title: Install OpenRAG in a Python project with uv
slug: /install-uv
---

For guided configuration and simplified service management, install OpenRAG with services managed by the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui).

You can use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install OpenRAG as a managed or unmanaged dependency in a new or existing Python project.

For other installation methods, see [Choose an installation method](/install-options).

## Prerequisites

- For Microsoft Windows, you must use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
See [Install OpenRAG on Windows](/install-windows) before proceeding.

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) version 3.13 or later.

- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

- Install [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) (recommended) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

- Install [Podman Compose](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html) or [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
To use Docker Compose with Podman, you must alias Docker Compose commands to Podman commands.

- Gather the credentials and connection details for your preferred model providers.

   - OpenAI: Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
   - Anthropic language models: Create an [Anthropic API key](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/api/reference).
   - IBM watsonx.ai: Get your watsonx.ai API endpoint, IBM project ID, and IBM API key from your watsonx deployment.
   - Ollama: Use the [Ollama documentation](https://docs.ollama.com/) to set up your Ollama instance locally, in the cloud, or on a remote server, and then get your Ollama server's base URL.

   You must have access to at least one language model and one embedding model.
   If your chosen provider offers both types, you can use the same provider for both models.
   If your provider offers only one type, such as Anthropic, you must select two providers.

- Optional: Install GPU support with an NVIDIA GPU, [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/) support, and compatible NVIDIA drivers on the OpenRAG host machine. If you don't have GPU capabilities, OpenRAG provides an alternate CPU-only deployment.

## Install and start OpenRAG with uv

There are two ways to install OpenRAG with `uv`:

* [**`uv add`** (Recommended)](#uv-add): Install OpenRAG as a managed dependency in a new or existing `uv` Python project.
This is recommended because it adds OpenRAG to your `pyproject.toml` and lockfile for better management of dependencies and the virtual environment.

* [**`uv pip install`**](#uv-pip-install): Use the [`uv pip` interface](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/) to install OpenRAG into an existing Python project that uses `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

If you encounter errors during installation, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).

### uv add {#uv-add}

1. Create a new `uv`-managed Python project:

    ```bash
    uv init PROJECT_NAME
    ```

2. Change into your new project directory:

    ```bash
    cd PROJECT_NAME
    ```

    Because `uv` manages the virtual environment for you, you won't see a `(venv)` prompt.
    `uv` commands automatically use the project's virtual environment.

2. Add OpenRAG to your project:

   * Add the latest version:

        ```bash
        uv add openrag
        ```

   * Add a specific version:

        ```bash
        uv add openrag==0.1.30
        ```

   * Add a local wheel:

        ```bash
        uv add path/to/openrag-VERSION-py3-none-any.whl
        ```

    For more options, see [Managing dependencies with `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/).

3. Start the OpenRAG TUI:

    ```bash
    uv run openrag
    ```

### uv pip install {#uv-pip-install}

1. Activate your virtual environment.

2. Install the OpenRAG Python package:

    ```bash
    uv pip install openrag
    ```

3. Start the OpenRAG TUI:

    ```bash
    uv run openrag
    ```

## Set up OpenRAG with the TUI

When the Terminal User Interface (TUI) starts, you must complete the initial setup to configure OpenRAG.
